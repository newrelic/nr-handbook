# New Relic Handbook.

## Introduction

As your digital business grows, your New Relic usage will likely grow with it. Often that means new business units in your organisation start to use New Relic, and they may turn to you for help with the set up of that. If that sounds like you then this handbook will likely help.

This handbook comes from you, and we hope will be built on by you. The information included in the initial version is built by our (New Relic Technical Support) experiences in helping customers in their issues, be them related to Account access , Alert configurations, or Applications and deployments related. 

_For Example; in our Support team we occasionally see requests for deleting personal accounts from a corporate master account. Specifically where a user at a company wanted to monitor their personal projects, so they added a sub-account to the company parent account._

## Usage
How you use the handbook is up to you. We provide this as a pre-built template, however your New Relic account usage is likely different to the next person to read this. So we encourage you to build on this handbook, add sections that suit your usage. 
For example; If you're heavy Synthetics users for example, you may add a section on Synthetics Permissions and Secure Credentials.

Since we provide this handbook in Markdown, you have a couple of options, but you are free to copy this into your preferred delivery method.

The way we went is to leave the handbook in github - since github nicely formats Markdown, this works well for us.

With all that said - we would love your help in building out our Handbook Template. If you think that the sections you add to your own would be valuable to others, please feel free to submit a PR here. We can review and chat with you about whether or not we can add it to ours, with the goal of building out a larger 'master list' handbook.


## Requirements
* The Handbook makes multiple references to 'Your Company'. These should be replaced with your company name.
* The Handbook includes a 'Your Logo Here' Placeholder. This should be replaced with your company logo. 
* The Handbook includes reference to a Slack channel called #new-relic-admins. This should be replaced with your preferred method of contact as the internal New Relic Experts in your company.
